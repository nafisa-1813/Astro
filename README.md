# Cassini-Huygens Mission: Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) Data Project  

## **Overview**  
This repository is dedicated to exploring data from the Cassini-Huygens mission, with a focus on the Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) instrument. The project aims to create an astrodynamical database of dust particles detected in the Saturnian system, analyze their properties, and uncover scientific insights using advanced computational techniques such as machine learning.

## **About the Cassini-Huygens Mission**  
The Cassini-Huygens mission was launched in 1997 as a collaboration between NASA, ESA, and international partners. It reached Saturn in 2004 and studied the planet, its rings, moons, and magnetosphere for over 13 years. Key highlights of the mission include:  
- The deployment of the Huygens probe, which landed on Titan, Saturn's largest moon.  
- Nearly 300 orbits around Saturn and 160 targeted flybys.  
- The discovery of six new moons and extensive studies of the cryovolcanic activity on Enceladus.  
- Collection of 640 GB of data, contributing to over 4,000 research papers.

## **Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA)**  
The CDA instrument was designed to study cosmic dust particles by measuring their velocity, mass, and chemical composition. Highlights of its functionality include:  
- Detection of particles from sources like Enceladus' cryovolcanic plumes and Saturn’s rings.  
- Use of a time-of-flight spectrometer to analyze particles' chemical composition.  
- Significant discoveries, such as confirming a subsurface ocean on Enceladus.  

## **Project Goals**  
This project seeks to process and analyze data from the CDA to achieve the following:  
1. **Calibration**: Use existing methods and machine learning to refine CDA's measurements.  
2. **Trajectory and Pointing Analysis**: Visualize Cassini’s orbits and CDA's detection zones.  
3. **Astrodynamical Database**: Build a database with properties of detected particles, including mass, velocity, and potential orbits.  
4. **Spectral Analysis**: Classify and interpret mass spectra using machine learning to understand particle composition.  

## **Repository Structure**  
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed CDA data.  
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, calibration, and visualization.  

## **Technologies and Tools**  
- **Python**: For data processing, visualization, and machine learning.  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive exploration and analysis.  
- **Matplotlib/Plotly**: For 2D and 3D visualizations of trajectories and spectra.  
- **Scikit-learn/TensorFlow**: For machine learning models.
